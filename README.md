The app:
========
Cloud based web app for recording travel expenses and coupling them with corporate travel entry.

The app consists of:
1. A service for communicating with the corporate travel system
1. A service that stores receipts
1. A web app that lets a user browse planned trips and register receipts

# Installation

* `npm install -g express`
* `npm install -g bower`
* `npm install -g nodemon`
* `npm install -g grunt`
* `mkdir data`

If no MongoDb is running, you should also run the following to start MongoDb:
* `mongod --bind_ip=localhost --dbpath=data --nojournal --rest "$@"`

## client

In the client/ directory run
`npm install && bower install`

### Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

### Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.

# Server

  * To run all tests
    * `grunt`
  * To start the service in "production" mode
    * `npm start`
